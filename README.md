# Analyzing 5 way interacting effects on BMI utilizing Entropy and Multinomial Simulation
Final project for STA 106: Analysis of Variance

This project utilizes the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset

**Project Guidelines:**

Divide the entire Kaggle version of BRFSS dataset with respect to categorical variable GenHealth into 5 sub-datasets. Again the focal measurement is BMI.

Within each sub-dataset, investigate the 3-way or 4-way or 5-way interacting effects on BMI distribution shapes pertaining to 3, 4 or 5 binary categorical variables of your choices.

Within each sub-dataset specific investigation, apply HC-approach and Entropy approach.

Each investigation must include reliability discussions concerning results derived from these two approaches based on simulated data from Multinomial random variables. (For reliability consideration on HC-approach, 5 HC-trees would be enough.)

Write a report by synthesizing results from your 5 investigations.
